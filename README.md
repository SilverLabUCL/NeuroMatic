NeuroMatic is a collection of WaveMetrics Igor Pro software tools for acquiring, analyzing and simulating electrophysiological data. By merging a wide range of tools into a single package, NeuroMatic facilitates a more integrated style of research. Being open source and of modular design, NeuroMatic allows users to develop their own analysis functions that can be easily incorporated into NeuroMatic’s framework.

Available Tool Tabs: Main, Stats, Spike, Event, Fit, Pulse, Model, Clamp, Demo

How To Install: Put NeuroMatic’s folder, or its shortcut, inside the Igor Procedures folder. Start WaveMetrics Igor Pro. NeuroMatic’s menu should appear within Igor’s main menu bar and NeuroMatic's panel should appear on the right side of Igor. Begin by opening a data file (NeuroMatic > Data Folder > Open Data Files).
